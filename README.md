A Todo App is a simple and effective way to manage your daily tasks and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. Using Javascript, we can create a Todo App with additional features like edit and delete functionality. These features make it easier to modify or remove tasks that have been added, which is especially useful for tasks that may change or become irrelevant over time.
